This example assumes that you are combining a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for a hybrid ASR system.

import numpy as np
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier
from hmmlearn import hmm

# Example feature vectors extracted from an audio file
# These would normally come from a feature extraction process like MFCC
features = np.array([[0.1, 0.5, 0.3], [0.4, 0.7, 0.6], [0.3, 0.4, 0.2], [0.7, 0.6, 0.8]])

# Example labels (corresponding phonemes or words)
labels = np.array([1, 2, 1, 3])

# Train a neural network to classify speech features
dnn = MLPClassifier(hidden_layer_sizes=(10,), max_iter=1000)
dnn.fit(features, labels)

# Predict the class labels for a new input feature set
new_features = np.array([[0.5, 0.6, 0.7]])
predicted_labels = dnn.predict(new_features)

# Now use HMM for sequential modeling (speech decoding)
model = hmm.MultinomialHMM(n_components=3)  # Assume 3 possible states for HMM
model.fit(features)  # Train HMM on features

# Use the trained model for decoding
hmm_predictions = model.predict(new_features)

print("DNN Prediction: ", predicted_labels)
print("HMM Prediction: ", hmm_predictions)
